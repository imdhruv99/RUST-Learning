# RUST-Learning
Becoming Rusty


# Commands
- `cargo check`: Analyze the current package and report errors, but don't build object files.
- `cargo build`: Compile the current package.
- `cargo run`: Run a binary or example of the local package.
- `rustc main.rs`: Compile the code and create the executable.
- `rustfmt main.rs`: Format the code.

# Anatomy
- **Traits:** Think of traits like roles or abilities that different things can have. For example, a trait might define that something can be "Printable" or "Discountable."

- **Structs:** Structs are like containers that hold different pieces of information together. If you have a person, a struct can contain their name, age, and other details.

- **Enums:** Enums allow you to define a type that can have different variations. For instance, in a game, you might have different types of characters like warriors, wizards, and archers.

- **Crates:** Crates are like packages of code in Rust. They group related functionality together. For example, you might have a crate for handling file operations.

- **Generics:** Generics in programming are like placeholders that let you write code without specifying exactly what types you're working with. It's a way to create functions, structures, or other code that can be used with different types.
